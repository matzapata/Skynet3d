Skynet3d firmware by Scou + Oderwat- has been evolving since it was first started. 
were now at the point where there are 2 different approaches to the skynet firmware which evolve seperately.

theres the Facebook version- By Scou. 
I take what Oderwat has released on Github and add in my custom profiles- written guides- troubleshooting- wiring diagrams and all the stuff you 
should hopefully need into one neat package to make installing, using and troubleshooting as easy as i can humanly make possible.

The second being the github version. Implemented by OderWat With some input and suggestions from the community. https://github.com/SkyNet3D/Marlin << this is the devel branch of skynet- 
this will be the latest and most up to date version ofSkynet3d firmware and wont follow the same versioning as the facebook release.
this version will  be further ahead than the fb release and will resemble as close to stock marlin as possible whilst having full anet support.  
it will not have all the profiles, guides and newbie friendly content that have become standard with the facebook releases
